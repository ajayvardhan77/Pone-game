# Pone-game
Pone game is fun to play and build, it is a console-basedÂ game, once you run the game, it opens up your console where you and your friend can play a game, my advice to you is to choose the left paddle rather than the right paddle.
steps to be considered while building the model are : 
step1: create a screen, and decide how big you want your game screen.
step2: create a paddle class, right paddle, and left paddle made from Paddle class from paddle.py file
step3: create a ball, initially ball should be placed in the middle
step4: Detect collision with the wall.
step5: Detect collision with paddle, if a collision occurs balls should reflect back in the opposite direction.
step6: Detect if any paddle misses the ball, if so opposite person should get the score.
step7: create a scoreboard, and update the scoreboard.
